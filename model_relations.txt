There are three types of table relations
1. One-to-One relation
2. One-to-Many relation (Many-to-One)
3. Many-to-Many Relation

# In such table relations the object of one table is referred in the other table using a unique
id which is also called as Foreign Key


Related Names
# Related names are the names (string) used in the model relations in django.
# These related names are used in the reverse relation. Lets take an example

    There is a "Classroom" model
    There is another "Student" model which has "Classroom" as a ForeignKey

    Now to access data of classroom from student object, it is a forward relation.
    But to access data of student from classroom object, it is a reverse relation and
    we can use related_names for this
